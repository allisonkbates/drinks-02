## Bugs (Right now, they're fixed by updating the content ðŸ˜¬)
- Bug when ingredients & preparation fields are filled out
- Empty state when no drinks can be found for that filter
- If less than 4 drinks are in a category, the table will render clones of the items and the layout will break

## Code Cleanliness / Future Issues
- Consider comments in /index page for how we're fetching the drinks
- Clean up specific drink page code
- Consider style refresh
